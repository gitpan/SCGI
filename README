SCGI - The Perl SCGI server library.

INSTALATION

perl Build.PL

./Build test
./Build install

KNOWN ISSUES

The SCGI Apache2 module had a bug (for me at least), which resulted in segmentation faults. This appeared after version 1.2 (the version in Debian Sarge) and was fixed in 1.10.

The SCGI Apache2 module has a bug where certain headers can be repeated. This is still present in version 1.10. A patch has been accepted and this issue should be resolved in the next release. This modulenow issues a warning on a repeated header, rather than throwing an exception as in the previous version.
